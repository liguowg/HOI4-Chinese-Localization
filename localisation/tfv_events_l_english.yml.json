Dozens of workers were killed and dozens more are still missing. Investigators are pursuing several leads, and a number of houses have already been searched. The results are deeply disturbing, ranging from Quit India propaganda to tools that could be used to create crude explosives. \\n\\nNone of those arrested seem to be the ringleaders, however, and they have so far refused to talk.",
